# NR2003 Stats Generator

This will be done in... *sigh* Python.

## Features
- Convert HTML race reports into data from database
- Retrieve data from database and generate HTML page for them
- Command Line interface - what we can do:
    - import HTML file into database (specify year and series)
    - generate driver report by id
    - generate season stats report by year and series (~ RR standings page)
    - generate track stats for a specific track by id

this is bare minimum. We can work on rest later.

## Progress Made
- Got scraper working
